# Overview

Welcome to my analysis of the performance of a fintech company in the Czech Republic. This project focuses on [Twisto.cz](https://www.twisto.cz) and was created as part of a case study during an interview process.  

The dataset provided by the company includes information about new client registrations, customer demographics such as age, gender, and education, as well as details of transactions and the use of payment extensions. 

Using Python, I explored the data to better understand who Twisto’s customers are, how they behave when making purchases, and how often payments are deferred. The goal of this project is to present an accessible, data-driven overview of customer behavior and highlight insights that could support business and product decisions.
